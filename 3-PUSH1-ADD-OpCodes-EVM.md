### Easy Explanation of **PUSH1** and **ADD** Opcodes in the EVM

In the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, opcodes are like small commands that tell the machine what to do with data. Here’s a simple explanation of two important opcodes, **PUSH1** and **ADD**, with a real-life example..

---

### 1. **PUSH1**
- **What it does**: This opcode "pushes" (or inserts) a 1-byte number onto the EVM stack.
- **Stack**: Think of the stack as a tower where you can only work with the items on top.

#### Real-life Example:
**Situation**: You’re stacking books on a table.

- **PUSH1** is like taking a book with the number **5** on the cover and placing it on top of the stack of books. Now, the number **5** is on top of the stack.

**In the EVM**:
```text
PUSH1 0x05  --> Pushes the number 5 onto the stack.
stack: [5]
```

### 2. ADD
- **What it does**: This opcode takes the top two numbers from the stack and adds them together.
- **Stack**: Again, we work with the items that are on top of the stack.

#### Real-life Example:
- **Situation**: Continuing with the book example, you have a book with the number **5** and then place another book with the number **3** on top.

- **ADD** is like taking these two books from the stack, adding the numbers on the covers **(5 + 3)**, and then placing a single book with the number **8** on top.

In the **EVM**:
```text
PUSH1 0x05  --> Pushes the number 5 onto the stack.
PUSH1 0x03  --> Pushes the number 3 onto the stack.
ADD         --> Adds the two numbers on the stack.

stack: [8]
```

### Summary:
- **PUSH1**: Adds a 1-byte number to the stack. It’s like stacking a book with a number.
- **ADD**: Takes the top two numbers from the stack, adds them, and places the result on top.

- Example:
```text
PUSH1 5 (place the book with the number 5).
PUSH1 3 (place the book with the number 3).
ADD (adds 5 + 3 = 8 and places the book with the number 8 on top).
```
