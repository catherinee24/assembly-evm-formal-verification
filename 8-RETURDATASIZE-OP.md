# Understanding `RETURNDATASIZE` in the EVM

## What Does `RETURNDATASIZE` Do?

In the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the opcode `RETURNDATASIZE` is used to get the size of the data returned by the last function call. Think of it as a way to measure the size of the "package" (data) that a function returns.

### Simple Explanation:
`RETURNDATASIZE` tells you how many bytes of data were returned by the most recent function call. It’s like asking, “How big is the data that I just received?”

### Why Is This Useful?
1. **Check if data was returned:** If a function doesn’t return any data, `RETURNDATASIZE` will be 0. This allows you to detect whether something was returned or not.
2. **Manage returned data:** Knowing the size of the returned data helps you decide what to do with it—whether to read, copy, or discard it.

### Real-World Example:
Imagine calling a function that returns an Ethereum address (which is 20 bytes). After the function call, `RETURNDATASIZE` would return 20, indicating that the result is 20 bytes long.

## Steps in the EVM:
1. Call a function that may return some data.
2. Use `RETURNDATASIZE` to check how many bytes were returned.
3. Use this information to process the returned data as needed.

## Example in Solidity
Even though `RETURNDATASIZE` is a low-level opcode, its functionality can be demonstrated in Solidity:

```solidity
contract Test {
    function getSize() public returns (uint) {
        // Call another function that returns a value
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("someFunction()"));
        
        // The size of the returned data is available through data.length
        return data.length;  // Equivalent to RETURNDATASIZE in low-level EVM
    }
}
```
### In the example above:

- The call function is used to invoke another function.
- The returned data size is determined by **data.length**, which is similar to what **RETURNDATASIZE** does at the EVM level.

#### ✨ Summary:
- **RETURNDATASIZE** returns the number of bytes of data returned by the most recent function call.
-- If no data was returned, the size will be 0.

> It’s particularly useful when working with dynamic calls where the size of the returned data isn’t known in advance.
